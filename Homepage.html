        <p>No matter what part of the world you live in odds are you have seen a personal vehicle or owned one yourself. Something we donâ€™t often think about in our everyday lives in why we drive the vehicles we do. Our own cars have a task to fill in our lives most of the time we choose ones that can fulfill those roles such as get us to work, to school, or wherever the day takes us. If we live in a climate with heavy snow in the winter, you might buy a car with and All-Wheel-Drive system or if you live in a city with tight compact roads you might buy a sub-compact car with very little space inside. On this site I want to go into more details about how our vehicles differ depending on where we live in the world.</p>
