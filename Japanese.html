          <p>Japanese car culture is the largest car type in the world currently. Cars from Japan are rated some of the most reliable vehicles on the road today and that is thanks to their focus on quality control and precise engineering. Cars from Japan have similar characteristics to European cars where they are compact and practical. They do not focus as much resources on performance cars but instead make cars that are reliable and built to last well over 200,000 miles. Some of the most popular car brands in the world including the top selling of all time, Toyota, come Japan. Examples of these companies are Honda, Mazda, Nissan, and their sister luxury brands which are Lexus, Acura, and Infinity. Much like Europe these cars need to be able to fit in tight spaces and down narrow alley ways and that plays a major factor in their design. They have always been innovative and filling gaps in consumer needs in all parts of the globe keeping them on top.

          <h2>These are two important cars in Japanese car culture</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h3>The Toyota Yaris</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Yaris is currently the top selling car in Japan and based its design and engine it is easy to see why. It is considered a supermini car meaning it is below even subcompact cars. It currently is only available in the Japanese market because many places around the world need cars with more space but the Yairs fits perfectly in the Japanese lifestyle. It is practical and but is far from sporty. They have future plans to bring a performance version of the Yaris to the United States but is currently only available in Europe and Japan. </p>
          <p></p>
          <h3>The Toyota Supra</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>Despite Japan being known for reliable compact cars, this car makes an exception and stands out in its class. The Toyota Supra is an icon in the car world for its styling and power. When engineers focus on things like performance and style things like reliability and practicality are usually forgotten about but not with the Supra, it holds up to the standard of Toyotas polices about quality control making it one of the most reasonable sports cars you can buy. The car isnâ€™t only popular because of its performance from the factory but also the ability to tune and modify it giving it more power. The Supra has gone through five different generation remakes and is still on sale today. The most famous version of the Supra is the fourth-generation model with good condition ones going for $70,000 dollars for a from 1994. The car continues to be an iconic sports car will be around for a long time.
