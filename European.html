          <h2>These are two important cars in Eruopean car culture</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h3>The Volkswagen Golf</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Golf currently the top selling car in all of Europe as of summer 2021 and has been near the top of the list for many years. The compact family by Volkswagen from Germany is stylish, practical, and fun to drive. It gets a combined thirty-three miles per gallon in the city and on the highway. It is the top selling car in Europe for many good reasons, even though its compact it still offers plenty of cargo room and is offered with a turbo charged engine giving it a respectable amount of power. It has been on the market since 1974 and will be here to stay for much longer in the future. 
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h3>The Lamborghini Countach</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Countach is often regarded as the greatest car to ever come from Lamborghini and for many good reasons. Countach is directly translated to “wow” in Italian and that is what the car did when it was first debuted in the 70’s. The car itself had very poor aerodynamic design and was cramped on the inside but that wasn’t the intentions of the car, it was made to impress people with its looks and style. It was an icon of it’s time as still has a look that makes it very distinguishing even to today’s standards. It was built from 1974 to 1990 with only 1,983 built. As of 2022 Lamborghini is brining back the cars name with a new design and is going to cost $2,640,000 dollars.
