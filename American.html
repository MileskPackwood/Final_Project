          <p>American cars aren’t always considered the most reliable, or practical but they are iconic and have a certain charm to them that draws people in to buying one. American roads are wide and open with long highways and mountain roads with rural back roads, so Americans want big cars with lots of space to hold all the kids the dog and then some. Car sales are reflected on this with the top three best selling cars in American being full sized pickup trucks. Americans tend to want big engines with soft and bouncy riding vehicles. Some of the biggest car brands in America include Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, and Dodge. American is the land of the Muscle cars, no other culture makes large boxy cars with big and loud engines in them like the Ford Mustang or the Dodge Charger. When it comes to cars in American a common trend is bigger is better.

          <h2>These are two important cars in American car culture</h2>
          <p></p>
          <h3>The Ford F-150</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>The F-150 is currently the bestselling vehicle in American and has been the best-selling truck for the past 44 years. It is a massive vehicle that comes with steps on the side to help you get into it. It comes with powerful engines to help you tow or haul anything you need. The plus side of driving a vehicle so large is that it is very safe to drive and can drive confidently through any weather situation. One of it’s biggest turn offs would be the fuel economy you get driving one. The average rating for a mid-trim level model would be around 20 miles per gallon combined city and highway driving. Year after year they continue to outsell the competition and the future is looking electric for the F-150 with hybrid options also available to counter its biggest flaw.

          <h3>The Dodge Charger</h3>
          <img src="https://www.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2020/07/2021-Dodge-Charger-SRT-Redeye-31.jpg?fit=around%7C875:492.1875" alt="Charger">
          <p></p>
          <p>The Dodge Charger is an American muscle car icon that has been around for many generations and has adapted along the way to meet consumer needs while also maintaining its roots. It has a distinctive aggressive look turn heads when it drives by. This car comes with powerful V8 engine options giving it the title of the words fastest production sedan. In recent years the Charger was even adopted as police cars and most used as highway patrol vehicles because of its ability to accelerate quickly from a stand still. Like the F-150 it uses a lot of gas and is large vehicle, it also seems that it will be having a future as an electric car, but nothing is confirmed yet. If gas powered cars are still available there will always be Chargers roaring down drag racing strips.
